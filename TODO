1. Create a tictactoe.js file
2. Include the tictactoe.js file the tictactoe.html file (using script tag).
2a. Research (using Javascript book) other ways to add javascript to an HTML page. Be prepared for a verbal test.
3. Add an ID to each cell (td) in the table. Remember IDs must be unique in an html page.
4. Create an onClick event in each cell. The onClick event should reference a function in your
  tictactoe.js -- when the cell (with id) is clicked, it will add an "X" to the cell. For now, just an X in cell when clicked 
  (later on -- another day -- we'll make the function add X in first cell, "O" in the next cell, "X" in the next cell...) 
5. Read the pages marked in the Javascript book about how Javacript is used in Browsers/html pages
