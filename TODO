1. Improve the tie logic (add "O"s to logic?, don't assume X goes first).

2. Let players know who won.

3. Add a timer (?) that reminds user they have X number of seconds to make a X or O, otherwise they will lose the game.

4. Add ability to add timer or not have a time on the game (for instance, a checkbox that makes the game timed). 

5. Add choice of person vs. person OR person vs. computer.

6. improve the design of the page (CSS and html). 
	- increase font size of Xs and Os
	- give it a page title
	- Add colors?
	- Add image?
